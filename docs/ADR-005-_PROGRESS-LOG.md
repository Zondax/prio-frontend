# ADR-005 Implementation Progress Log

**Status**: Completed  
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-06  
**Parent ADR**: [ADR-005-STOREBUILDER-ARCHITECTURE.md](./ADR-005-STOREBUILDER-ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Purpose

This document logs the implementation progress of the StoreBuilder architecture outlined in ADR-005.

## Progress Log

### 2025-07-04 - Implementation Analysis
- ‚úÖ **Complete StoreBuilder system implemented** - Full builder pattern architecture
  - `libs/stores/src/storeBuilders/` directory contains complete implementation
  - All specialized store builders implemented for different data patterns
- ‚úÖ **Base store foundation** - Common functionality shared across all store types
  - `baseStore.ts` - Core store functionality and common patterns
  - `baseStore.test.ts` - Comprehensive base store testing
- ‚úÖ **Specialized builders implemented** - Purpose-built stores for specific patterns
  - `grpcSingleMethodStore.ts` - Simple request/response pattern
  - `grpcReadStreamStore.ts` - Real-time streaming data pattern  
  - `grpcPageableStore.ts` - Pagination and list management
  - `grpcOptimisticStore.ts` - Optimistic updates with rollback
- üß™ **Comprehensive testing suite** - All store builders thoroughly tested
  - `grpcSingleMethodStore.test.ts` - Single method store unit tests
  - `grpcSingleMethodStore.cancellation.test.ts` - Cancellation behavior tests
  - `grpcReadStreamStore.test.ts` - Stream store testing
  - `grpcPageableStore.test.ts` - Pageable store testing
  - `grpcOptimisticStore.test.ts` - Optimistic store unit tests
  - `grpcOptimisticStore.raceConditions.test.ts` - Race condition handling tests
  - `cancellation.test.ts` - Cross-store cancellation testing
  - `retry.test.ts` - Retry mechanism testing
- ‚úÖ **Production usage** - Store builders in active use
  - `packages/state/src/stores/chat.ts` - Chat store using builder pattern
  - `packages/state/src/stores/endpoints.ts` - Endpoint store implementation
  - Flow store and drilldown stores using builder patterns
- ‚úÖ **Type safety implementation** - Full TypeScript integration
  - Generic builders with comprehensive type safety
  - Test utilities for store testing patterns

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ **Fully implemented and production-ready** - Complete StoreBuilder architecture working
- ‚úÖ **All patterns covered** - Single method, streaming, pageable, and optimistic patterns
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive testing** - Race conditions, cancellation, retry mechanisms all tested
- ‚úÖ **Active production use** - Chat, endpoint, flow, and drilldown stores using builders
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Blocked by**: None - implementation complete and stable

## Key Decisions Made
- **Builder pattern approach**: Specialized store builders for different data interaction patterns
- **Zustand foundation**: Built on top of Zustand for performance and simplicity
- **Comprehensive testing**: Full test coverage including edge cases and race conditions
- **Type-safe interfaces**: Complete TypeScript integration with generic builders
- **gRPC optimization**: Specialized builders optimized for gRPC interaction patterns
- **Cancellation support**: Built-in cancellation and cleanup across all store types

## Architecture Summary

**Implementation Status**: ‚úÖ Complete and Production-Ready
- Builder pattern state management fully operational
- All four major patterns implemented: Single Method, Read Stream, Pageable, Optimistic
- Comprehensive test coverage including race conditions and edge cases
- Type-safe interfaces with full TypeScript integration
- Active production usage across chat, endpoints, flow, and drilldown features

**Current Usage**: Production-ready state management system powering chat functionality, endpoint management, flow diagrams, and drilldown interactions with robust error handling and performance optimization.
