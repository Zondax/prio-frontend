## Key Decisions Made
- **Progress tracking approach**: Use simple progress log instead of complex future planning
- **Naming convention**: `ADR-XXX-_PROGRESS-LOG.md` for clear ordering and purpose
- **Implementation strategy**: Incremental refactor with feature flags to maintain existing functionality
- **Progressive implementation requirement**: ADR-001 must be implemented progressively with testable progress over time, not necessarily following the ADR's original phase order but prioritizing demonstrable, working improvements at each step
- **ChatInput refactor approach**: Started with improving composability and separation of concerns rather than generic types
- **Testing-first strategy**: Established visual regression testing before major changes to track migration progress

## Architecture Analysis Summary

**Current System** (`/ks-frontend/libs/ui-common/src/components/chat/`):
- ✅ **Strengths**: Comprehensive features, CVA styling, React 19, modern patterns
- ❌ **Issues**: Hardcoded types, monolithic components, 3 separate interaction systems
- 📦 **Components**: 12 core components + extensions (types.ts is 475 lines)

**Refactor Strategy**: Incremental approach with feature flags, starting with generic `BaseMessage<TRole, TContent>` foundation and consolidating interaction systems.
