# ADR-008 Implementation Progress Log

**Status**: Implemented  
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-06  
**Parent ADR**: [ADR-008-OBSERVABILITY.md](./ADR-008-OBSERVABILITY.md)

## Purpose

This document logs the implementation progress of the OpenTelemetry observability architecture outlined in ADR-008.

## Progress Log

### 2025-07-04 - Implementation Analysis
- ✅ **@zondax/otel-web library implemented** - Complete OpenTelemetry library deployed
  - `libs/otel-web/` directory contains full implementation
  - Shared library for consistent instrumentation across applications
  - Both client and server-side instrumentation patterns
- ✅ **Client-side instrumentation** - Browser performance tracking implemented
  - `client/OtelProvider.tsx` - React provider for client-side telemetry
  - `client/index.ts` - Client instrumentation initialization
  - Browser performance monitoring and user interaction tracking
- ✅ **Server-side instrumentation** - Next.js server tracing implemented
  - `server/instrumentation.ts` - Server-side OpenTelemetry setup
  - `server/index.ts` - Server instrumentation utilities
  - `apps/web/instrumentation.ts` - Next.js integration
  - Vercel OTel integration for production tracing
- ✅ **Comprehensive testing** - Full test coverage for telemetry library
  - `__tests__/client/OtelProvider.test.tsx` - Client provider testing
  - `__tests__/client/index.test.ts` - Client instrumentation tests
  - `__tests__/server/index.test.ts` - Server instrumentation tests
  - `__tests__/server/instrumentation.test.ts` - Server setup tests
  - `__tests__/setup.ts` - Test environment configuration
- ✅ **Production deployment** - Observability system operational
  - SigNoz Cloud (EU) integration configured
  - Client and server tracing active in production
  - Performance monitoring and error tracking working

## Current Status
- ✅ **Fully implemented and operational** - Complete OpenTelemetry architecture working
- ✅ **@zondax/otel-web library deployed** - Shared library providing consistent instrumentation
- ✅ **Client and server monitoring** - Both browser and server-side telemetry active
- ✅ **SigNoz integration** - Production observability backend configured and operational
- ✅ **Comprehensive testing** - Full test coverage for telemetry functionality
- ⏸️ **Blocked by**: None - observability system implemented and operational

## Key Decisions Made
- **OpenTelemetry standards**: Full compliance with OTel specifications for vendor neutrality
- **Shared library approach**: @zondax/otel-web for consistent instrumentation patterns
- **SigNoz Cloud (EU)**: European data residency for compliance requirements
- **Full-stack instrumentation**: Both client-side and server-side telemetry
- **Testing comprehensive**: Full test coverage for reliability
- **Vercel integration**: Optimized for Vercel deployment platform

## Architecture Summary

**Implementation Status**: ✅ Complete and Operational
- OpenTelemetry-first observability architecture fully deployed
- @zondax/otel-web shared library providing consistent instrumentation
- Client-side browser performance and interaction tracking
- Server-side Next.js tracing with Vercel OTel integration
- SigNoz Cloud (EU) backend for traces, metrics, and logs
- Comprehensive test coverage ensuring reliability

**Current Usage**: Production observability system monitoring application performance, user interactions, API calls, and server-side operations with actionable insights for debugging and optimization across all frontend applications.
