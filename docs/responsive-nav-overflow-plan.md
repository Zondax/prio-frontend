# Responsive Navigation Overflow Detection: Sequential Thinking Plan

## Problem & Goals

- **Problem:** Need to switch between `NavDesktop` and `NavMobile` based on available space, without UI flashing or infinite toggling.
- **Goals:**
  - Overflow detection logic is reusable and testable.
  - No visible flashing or layout instability.
  - Solution is maintainable and extensible.

---

## Stepwise Plan

### 1. Reusable Overflow Detection Hook

- Build a `useOverflow` hook for any DOM node.
- Support margin thresholds and easy unit testing.

### 2. Hidden Measurement Node

- Render a hidden copy of `NavDesktop` in the DOM for overflow measurement.

- Use CSS to ensure it does not affect layout or accessibility:

  ```css
  position: absolute;
  visibility: hidden;
  pointer-events: none;
  height: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
  aria-hidden: true;
  ```

### 3. Debounced State Switching

- Debounce overflow state changes (e.g., 100â€“200ms) to prevent rapid toggling or race conditions.

### 4. Dynamic Content Handling

- Ensure the overflow check reacts to dynamic content changes (not just window resize).
- Consider using `ResizeObserver` or mutation observers for robust measurement.

### 5. Switching Logic in TopBar

- Only show one navigation (`NavDesktop` or `NavMobile`) to the user, based on the measured overflow.
- The other navigation is only present for measurement (hidden).

### 6. Testing and Documentation

- Write unit tests for the hook and integration tests for the switching logic.
- Manual QA: resize window, add/remove nav items, change zoom, check accessibility.
- Document the approach for future maintainers.

## Edge Cases & Risks

- **Dynamic content:** Nav items may change at runtime.
- **Font/zoom changes:** User settings could affect measurements.
- **Accessibility:** Hidden node must not be focusable or screen-reader visible.
- **Performance:** Debounce must be tuned to avoid lag or missed updates.

### Mitigation Strategies

- Use robust observers for measurement.
- Add `aria-hidden` and proper CSS to the measurement node.
- Test across browsers and with accessibility tools.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Manual testing: Resize, add/remove nav items, change zoom.
- [ ] Automated tests: Simulate overflow and ensure correct switching.
- [ ] Accessibility review: Confirm hidden node is truly hidden.
- [ ] Documentation: Keep this plan up to date.
