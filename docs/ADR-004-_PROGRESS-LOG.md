# ADR-004 Implementation Progress Log

**Status**: Implemented  
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-06  
**Parent ADR**: [ADR-004-LAYOUT-PRESETS.md](./ADR-004-LAYOUT-PRESETS.md)

## Purpose

This document logs the implementation progress of the multi-layer layout preset architecture outlined in ADR-004.

## Progress Log

### 2025-07-04 - Implementation Analysis
- ✅ **Chat layout presets implemented** - ChatContainer has full preset system
  - `chat-container.tsx` implements layout variants: standard, threaded, focused, presentation
  - Responsive behavior with CVA variants (responsive: true/false)
  - Theme integration (auto, light, dark, high-contrast)
  - Sidebar presets (bookmarks, threads, users, none)
- ✅ **Flow layout components** - Flow layout system implemented  
  - `libs/ui-common/src/components/flow/LayoutControls.tsx` - Layout control component
  - Flow layout presets for data visualization and workflow interfaces
- ✅ **Storybook documentation** - Comprehensive layout preset documentation
  - `stories/layouts/Layouts.stories.tsx` - General layout documentation
  - `stories/LayoutControls.stories.tsx` - Layout controls examples
  - `stories/FlowLayoutPresets.stories.tsx` - Flow-specific layout presets
  - `stories/ChatContainer.stories.tsx` - Chat layout preset examples
- ✅ **Component-level presets** - Specialized layout configurations
  - Chat layouts: standard, threaded, focused, presentation modes
  - Flow layouts: control and workflow-oriented layouts
  - Responsive behavior built into all preset systems

## Current Status
- ✅ **Core architecture implemented** - Multi-layer layout preset system working
- ✅ **Chat and Flow presets active** - Major layout families implemented
- ✅ **Responsive behavior** - All presets adapt to screen size and device capabilities
- ⟳ **Ongoing expansion** - More layout families can be added as needed
- ⏸️ **Blocked by**: None - core system implemented and extensible

## Key Decisions Made
- **CVA-based preset variants**: Using CVA for type-safe layout variant management
- **Component-specific presets**: Each major component family has its own preset system
- **Responsive by default**: All layout presets include responsive behavior
- **Storybook documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for all layout patterns
- **Composition-based**: Layout components can be composed and extended

## Architecture Summary

**Implementation Status**: ✅ Implemented and Active
- Multi-layer layout preset architecture operational
- Chat layout presets: standard, threaded, focused, presentation
- Flow layout presets for data visualization workflows
- Responsive behavior integrated across all presets
- Comprehensive Storybook documentation for layout patterns

**Current Usage**: Chat components using layout presets extensively, Flow components implementing specialized layout controls, all with responsive behavior and theme integration.
