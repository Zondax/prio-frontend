# ADR-007 Implementation Progress Log

**Status**: Implemented  
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-06  
**Parent ADR**: [ADR-007-TESTING.md](./ADR-007-TESTING.md)

## Purpose

This document logs the implementation progress of the testing standards and architecture outlined in ADR-007.

## Progress Log

### 2025-07-04 - Implementation Analysis
- ✅ **Vitest-first testing architecture implemented** - Full migration to Vitest complete
  - All 77+ test files in `libs/` using Vitest framework
  - Native Vitest assertions adopted (migrated from jest-dom)
  - Performance improvements from native assertion usage
- ✅ **Comprehensive test coverage** - Extensive testing across all major components
  - Store builders: Complete test coverage including race conditions and edge cases
  - UI components: Component testing with @testing-library/react
  - Virtualization: VGrid and VTable components fully tested
  - Chat components: ChatInput and related components tested
  - Embedded components: Provider and HOC patterns tested
- ✅ **Visual testing with Storybook + Playwright** - Visual regression testing implemented
  - `apps/storybook/tests/` contains visual regression tests
  - ChatInput visual tests with baseline screenshots
  - Separate visual and style test configurations
  - CPU core auto-detection for optimized test performance
- ✅ **Testing standards in CLAUDE.md** - Clear testing guidelines documented
  - File naming conventions: `*.test.ts` for unit tests, `*.spec.ts` for E2E tests
  - Native Vitest assertions patterns documented
  - Biome linter integration to enforce testing standards
- ✅ **CI/CD integration** - Testing integrated into deployment pipeline
  - Automated test runs on all commits
  - Visual regression testing in CI
  - Coverage reporting and validation
- ✅ **Test organization patterns** - Clear testing patterns established
  - Unit tests co-located with components
  - Integration tests for complex workflows
  - Visual tests for UI consistency
  - Performance tests for virtualization components

## Current Status
- ✅ **Fully implemented and operational** - Comprehensive testing architecture working
- ✅ **High test coverage** - 77+ test files covering all major functionality
- ✅ **Visual regression testing** - Storybook + Playwright visual testing active
- ✅ **Standards documented** - Clear testing guidelines in CLAUDE.md
- ✅ **CI/CD integrated** - Automated testing in deployment pipeline
- ⏸️ **Blocked by**: None - testing standards implemented and operational

## Key Decisions Made
- **Vitest-first approach**: Migrated from Jest to Vitest for better performance and compatibility
- **Native assertions**: Adopted native Vitest assertions instead of jest-dom
- **File naming conventions**: Strict `.test.ts` vs `.spec.ts` separation
- **Visual regression testing**: Playwright integration with Storybook for visual validation
- **Co-located tests**: Tests live alongside the code they test
- **Performance focus**: Optimized test configurations for fast feedback loops

## Architecture Summary

**Implementation Status**: ✅ Complete and Operational
- Vitest-first testing architecture fully deployed
- 77+ test files providing comprehensive coverage
- Visual regression testing with Storybook and Playwright
- Native Vitest assertions for better performance
- Clear testing standards documented and enforced
- CI/CD integration with automated test runs

**Current Usage**: All major components and systems thoroughly tested with unit, integration, and visual tests. Testing standards actively enforced through linting and documented patterns, providing reliable quality assurance across the entire codebase.
