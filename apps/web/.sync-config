# z Sync Configuration
# This file contains instructions and patterns for the sync command.
# It can include exclusions, priorities, custom rules, and any sync-related configurations.
#
# Format:
# - Lines starting with # are comments
# - Sections are marked with [section_name]
# - Plain text descriptions and patterns are supported

[repos]
# Git repositories to include in sync analysis
# These will be auto-discovered on first run if not specified

[ignored_repos]
# Git repositories to permanently ignore
# These will not be prompted for inclusion in future runs

[template]
# The template repository (source of truth for syncing)
# Will be prompted for selection on first run if not specified

[relationships]
# Repository relationships (auto-discovered and user-confirmed)
# template = ks-frontend
# derivatives = prio-frontend, kedge-frontend, paseo-frontend

[patterns]
# Learned patterns for automatic classification
# template_indicators = template, base, starter, kickstarter, ks-
# derivative_indicators = -frontend, -app, -client, -service

[history]
# Track sync decisions for learning
# 2025-01-19: Synced gRPC patterns from ks-frontend to paseo-frontend
# 2025-01-19: User rejected team management sync to kedge-frontend

[ignore]
# Patterns and features to exclude from synchronization
Custom authentication implementations
Derivative-specific branding
Environment configuration files
.env*
Local development settings
Deployment configurations
Customer-specific features
API endpoint customizations
Internal documentation
docs/internal/*
config/local/*

[priority]
# High-priority patterns that should be synced first
Security fixes
Critical bug fixes
Dependency security updates

[rules]
# Custom sync rules and instructions
# Always sync package.json security updates
# Preserve local authentication customizations
# Sync UI components but not business logic
# Keep derivative-specific API endpoints

[mappings]
# File/directory mappings for different structures
# template:src/components -> derivative:src/ui/components
# template:config/shared -> derivative:config/common

[timeouts]
# Timeout values in seconds for different operations
# git_operations=30
# package_analysis=15
# submodule_check=20
# default=30

[notes]
# Additional notes for AI and human operators
# This is prio-frontend - customer-specific features in src/features/prio/
# Authentication uses different OAuth provider than template
# Custom analytics implementation - do not override
