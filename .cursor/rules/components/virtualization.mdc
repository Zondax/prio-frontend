# Virtualization Guidelines

## VirtualizedGrid Component

- The VirtualizedGrid component supports 'debug' and 'showGrid' properties for visualizing grid layout
- These properties can be conditionally rendered based on user preferences
- The grid uses a responsive column configuration system with sm/md/lg breakpoints
- Performance optimizations are in place with virtualization for handling large lists

## General Virtualization Best Practices

- Use virtualization when dealing with large lists (100+ items) to improve performance
- When adding virtualization, DO NOT change the current working layout
- When combining with infinite scroll, prefer the virtualization library's built-in intersection detection
- Always maintain smooth scrolling by properly handling scroll position restoration
- Consider adding a small overscan (items rendered outside view) for smoother scrolling
- It is fine if you request a bit more rows (bigger page size) than necessary. We can create bigger windows as long as you can avoid
