# Authentication Provider Guidelines

## Provider Setup

- AuthProvider requires a `routes` prop defining protected and unprotected navigation paths
- Routes should be imported from routeConfig and passed directly to AuthProvider
- Routes configuration is used for handling protected route access and navigation control

## Implementation Best Practices

- Implement proper loading states during authentication checks
- Handle authentication errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- Use TypeScript for type-safe route configuration
- Consider implementing role-based access control (RBAC)
- Handle session persistence appropriately
- Implement proper cleanup on unmount
- Use proper error boundaries for authentication-related errors
- Consider implementing authentication state persistence
- Handle deep linking and authentication flows properly
