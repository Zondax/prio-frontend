# Testing React Hooks

## Challenges with Complex Hook Testing

When testing React hooks with complex state management, consider these challenges:

1. **State Updates are Asynchronous**: React's state updates don't immediately reflect in test environments
2. **Effects Need Time to Run**: useEffect functions may not run synchronously in tests
3. **Mocking Dependencies is Tricky**: Complex hooks often have dependencies that are hard to mock
4. **Debounced Functions**: Timers and debounced functions need special handling

## Effective Hook Testing Strategies

1. **Test Public API Structure**: Verify the hook returns the expected properties and functions
2. **Test Simple Behavior**: Test straightforward, synchronous functionality first
3. **Skip Complex State Tests** when they're brittle or difficult to set up
4. **Document Testing Limitations**: Add comments explaining why certain tests are skipped
5. **Use Integration Tests**: For complex state interactions, integration tests often work better

## Example - Simple Hook Test

```typescript
it('should return expected public API', () => {
  const { result } = renderHook(() => useMyHook())
  
  expect(result.current).toHaveProperty('value')
  expect(result.current).toHaveProperty('setValue')
  expect(typeof result.current.setValue).toBe('function')
})
```

## Common Workarounds

- **Mock useState**: Try spying on React.useState to verify setters are called
- **WaitFor**: Use waitFor to wait for asynchronous updates
- **No Side Effects**: Avoid tests that depend on side effects completing
- **Simple Assertions**: Focus on testing structure rather than state values
